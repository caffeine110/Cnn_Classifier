## AIM : 
Classification of images using Convolutional Neural Network.

## Introduction
It is very easy to recognise the image for a human one, but for a computer it is very difficult to do that. Convolutions Neural Network allows us to analyse the image content. CNN can be implimented using the sklearn library, CNN model take images as input to model and after the classfication we get the result in predicted classes.


## Keywords 
Keywords : Machine Learning, CNN, Image Processing, Matplotlib.

## Tools
PreRequirements :

		 LIBRARIES 	: Sklearn, Keras, matplotlib.
		 IDE 		: spyder


Classfy the images and store them into respective folders, built the model using keras 


## procedure to run
Procedure to Exicute the Program: 

	1). Exctraction :
		Dataset is Downloaded form Kaggle
	2). Preporcessing
		Images are proprocessed and no need to resize and if needed we can resize them using numpy.
	3). Model Training
		Run the model.fit statement
	4). prediction
		To predict the images content run the model.predict command with argument as a numpy matrix


## Evaluation Plan
As this is a Classification Problem we can calculate the accuracy of model from sklearn.metrics using accuacy Score.
